Sms Alarm
=========

Sms Alarm is an application for Android&Ttrade; devices which makes it's easier for you to notice when you have received an alarm, or just an important sms.

Overview
--------
Sms Alarm is developed with first response persons (rescue services and so on) in mind and the purpose with this application is to make it easier for those to notice an incoming alarm and thereby respond faster. 
It works by listening to sms from user configured phone numbers, when an sms is received from any of the configured numbers the application plays another signal and vibrate in another pattern. By doing this the user immediately knows whether it was a "normal" sms or an important sms(alarm). This is just a short description about the basic concept but it has a couple more features that's explained in more detail on other sections on this website.

Installation & prerequisites
----------------------------
In order to run this application you obviously needs a device running Android&trade;. Sms Alarm is developed for Android&trade; version 4.3(Jellybean) but runs fine on minimum 2.2(Froyo).<br />
Sms Alarm is available through Google Play&trade; and is installed just as a normal application.
